# Tasks

Tasks are the fundamental units of work in BlueprintAI. They represent actionable items that need to be completed.

## Structure

A Task consists of the following key properties:

- **ID**: Unique identifier (UUID).
- **Title**: A concise description of the task.
- **Status**: The current state of the task (e.g., `todo`, `in-progress`, `done`).
- **Priority**: Certainty of urgency (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`).
- **Label**: Categorization tag (e.g., `feature`, `bug`, `documentation`).

## Subtasks

Tasks can have subtasks, allowing for granular breakdown of complex activities. Subtasks share the same structure as parent tasks but are nested within them.

## Markdown Support

The core of a Task's detailed description is written in Markdown. This allows for rich text formatting, code blocks, and lists to clearly define requirements.
