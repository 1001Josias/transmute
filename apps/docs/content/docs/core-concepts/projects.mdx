# Projects

Projects are high-level containers for organizing Tasks. They usually represent a specific initiative, product, or large feature set.

## Organization

Projects are stored in the `projects/` directory at the root of the monorepo. Each project has its own workspace and configuration.

### Structure

A typical project structure looks like this:

```
projects/
  ├── my-project/
  │   ├── prd.md        # Product Requirement Document
  │   ├── tasks.md      # Task list and status
  │   └── ...
```

## Task Parsing

BlueprintAI automatically parses `tasks.md` files within project directories to generate the task board and list views in the web application.
