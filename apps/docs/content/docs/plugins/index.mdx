# Plugins

Transmute can be extended with plugins that integrate with AI coding assistants and development tools.

## Available Plugins

### OpenCode Transmute

The **opencode-transmute** plugin integrates Transmute with [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), enabling AI agents to create isolated development environments for each task using git worktrees.

## Plugin Architecture

Plugins in Transmute follow a simple pattern:

1. **Tools** - Functions that AI agents can call to perform actions
2. **Configuration** - User-customizable settings loaded from config files
3. **Adapters** - Integrations with external tools (terminals, IDEs, etc.)

## Creating Plugins

Plugins are npm packages that export a `Plugin` function compatible with the host platform (e.g., OpenCode).

```typescript
import type { Plugin } from "@opencode-ai/plugin";

export const MyPlugin: Plugin = async (ctx) => {
  return {
    tool: {
      "my-tool": tool({
        description: "My custom tool",
        args: {
          /* ... */
        },
        execute: async (args) => {
          /* ... */
        },
      }),
    },
  };
};
```
